# Fancy working at PromptWorks? 

## Here is your opportunity to woo us

Like any proper organization, we're rather discerning of the bedfellows we choose, and require would-be consorts to practice a bit of courtship. Part of this ritual is completing the exercise described below for our appraisal. Should your work woo us, your code curry our favor, your tests tickle our fancy, or your refactoring regale us, then maybe we can talk dowery. Thank you in advance for indulging us with your implementation.

  1. Make a private fork of this repo

  2. Try your hand at the following exercise.

    ### suitor

    This Ruby script sends an SMS message containing the top [Reddit /r/romance](http://www.reddit.com/r/romance) post. Currently the only interface to the script the command line (`/bin/suitor`).
    
    Below is a list features for you to implement, including some in-browser features which will require software to handle HTTP requests perhaps using a web framework like Rails or Sinatra.

    As you add the following features, please refactor the current implementation and test suite, adding new tests as you see fit and making commits with charming, informative messages.

      1. Command line users should specify a subreddit (e.g. "doge")

      2. Command line users should specify a phone number

      3. Browser users should specify a subreddit and their phone number, then click a button to have the top post sent to them

      4. Browser users should see a success message after they have clicked a button and successfully requested an SMS be sent _without the page reloading_

      5. Implement a feature or improvement of your choosing

  3. Deploy your app so that it is available via the internet. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) offers a free, easy to use platform for such things.

  4. Submit a pull request with your thoughts about the exercise and a link to your deployed web app.
